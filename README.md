# The Best Books of All Time - Homework 2

## Project Description

This Python project focuses on analyzing data from two JSON files: "books.json" and "authors.json". The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answer several research questions to gain insights into the dataset.

## Research Questions

### [RQ1] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before delving into specific research questions, the project conducts exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset better. This involves providing meaningful statistical summaries through visualizations and tabular tools.

### [RQ2] Vital Information Retrieval
1. **Number of Books per Author:** Visualizes the distribution of the number of books authored by each author in descending order.
   
2. **Book with the Highest Number of Reviews:** Identifies the book with the highest number of reviews.

3. **Top and Worst Books by Average Score:** Lists the top ten and worst ten books based on their average score.

4. **Language Distribution:** Explores the different languages in the dataset and provides a chart summarizing their distribution.

5. **Books with More than 250 Pages:** Determines the number of books in the dataset that have more than 250 pages.

6. **Fans Count Distribution:** Plots the distribution of fans count for the 50 most prolific authors.

### [RQ3] Historical Analysis
For a historical perspective, a function is implemented to take a year as input and return the following information:
   
- The number of books published in that year.
   
- The total number of pages written in that year.
   
- The most prolific month of that year.
   
- The longest book written in that year.

### [RQ5] We can consider the authors with the most fans to be influential. Letâ€™s have a deeper look.

- Plot the top 10 most influential authors regarding their fan count and number of books. Who is the most influential author?

## Data Sources

The dataset comprises two JSON files:

- "books.json": Contains information about books, including title, author, rating, publications date, pages, language, etc.
   
- "authors.json": Provides details about authors, such as name, number of fans, books written, etc.

## Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into the dataset through exploratory data analysis and addresses specific research questions to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the data.
